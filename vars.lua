        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Mason.
            I'm a currently a student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            My primary interest is in low-level programming, but I have dipped
            my toes into some physics and computational biology before, too.

            On the side, I also enjoy running, skiing, and building stuff with
            power tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            Want to chat about something? Feel free to get in touch using my
            email above!
        </p>
