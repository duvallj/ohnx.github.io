        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Mason.
            I like to tinker with computers, electronics, and code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently a first-year student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
            One day, I hope to design and research chips that help solve problems in computational biology and/or machine learning.
        </p>
