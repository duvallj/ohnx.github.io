            Hi there! My name is Mason.
            I like to tinker with computers, electronics and code.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day, I hope to design and research chips that help solve problems in computational biology and/or machine learning.
            For now, though, I'm still working my way through my studies in high school.
        </p>
        <p>
            I entertain the idea that I'm not a complete nerd by skiing (when there's snow on the ground) and running (when there isn't).
        </p>
