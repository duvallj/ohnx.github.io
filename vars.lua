        <p>
            Hi there. My name is Mason.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to explore how the world works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Computers are becoming an increasingly larger and more important part of our lives.
            Consequently, one of my interests is understanding how computers work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, as part of my quest for knowledge,
            I interest myself by programming in low-level languages, exploring hobby OS's,
            learning about network protocols, and exploring chip design/simulation.
        </p>
