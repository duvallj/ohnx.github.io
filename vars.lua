        <p>
            Hi there. My name is Mason.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy low-level programming, learning new things, and nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I program a lot of random stuff in C, some of which can
            be seen on my GitHub page.
        </p>
