        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Mason.
            I am currently a tech worker based in New York City.
        </p>
        <p>
            My job title is Linux Engineer, which means I get to think about
            ways to maintain and improve the reliability of computer systems.
            Outside of work, I enjoy coding for personal projects,
            theatre, cycling, reading, skiing, trivia, and exploring the city.
        </p>
        <p>
            Want to chat about something? Feel free to get in touch using my
            email above!
