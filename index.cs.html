                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm a tinkerer at heart. That's pretty much the most important thing to know about me.
                    I pretty much constantly (when I have the time) fiddle with electronics and muck about with programs to try to discover new things (this is still pretty easy for me since I don't know much).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew up in the age of technology, so since a young age (I'm not really old enough to say "since I was a kid" yet),
                    I was lucky enough to be surrounded by cool gadgets and gizmos that would light up and show words, pictures, and all sorts of other things that I could barely imagine.
                    <!-- and also unlucky enough to be constantly distracted by these things when I should be doing homework... -->
                    I was entranced by these contraptions and took every opportunity I could to explore how they worked, whether it was poking my head behind computers to see where wires go,
                    taking apart electronics (but never putting them back together again since I lost a screw), 
                    writing programs to practice multiplying numbers, or setting up a new wireless router that my family got.
                    As I grew older and understood more of the things I saw around me, I've also expanded my interests into
                    circuits (most of them involving my Ardiuno or Raspberry Pi) and more programs (ranging from websites to phone apps to low-level operating system interfaces).
                </p>
                <!--
                fix grammar issues with this paragraph - it sounds weird
                <p>
                    I believe in helping others.
                    To me, this means doing whatever I can to try to improve the lives of everyone around the world,
                    whether it's indirectly, such as writing programs that can assist people, or directly, such as helping out at a local food bank.
                    This might seem like quite the ambitious goal. but in today's internet-connected day and age where everyone can make a difference, I believe that a single person making a large impact is entirely possible.
                </p>
                -->
                <p>
                    I also like skiing, swimming, writing, and debating. I might not be good at any of them, but I still do enjoy doing stuff that isn't technology-related sometimes. <!-- Once in a blue moon -->
