            <div>I have a lot of projects of all shapes and sizes. It's the natural result of a person who has many interests.</div>
            <div>Most of my projects tend to be on the simpler side of things as I don't have enough time to invest in large-scale projects, unfortunately. Nonetheless, they still can be very useful sometimes.</div>
            <div>Not all of my projects are listed here; only the ones that I directly own. I contribute to other open-source projects often as well. Those projects can be seen <a href="https://github.com/ohnx">on my GitHub profile</a>.</a></div>
