            <h1>Mason's portfolio</h1>
            <p>I have a lot of projects of all shapes and sizes. It's the natural result of a person who has many interests.</p>
            <p>Most of my projects tend to be on the simpler side of things as I don't have enough time to invest in large-scale projects, unfortunately. Nonetheless, they still can be very useful sometimes.</p>
            <p>Not everything that I have ever worked on is listed here; only the ones that I directly own. I contribute to other open-source projects often as well. Those projects can be seen <a href="https://github.com/ohnx">on my GitHub profile</a>.</a></p>
