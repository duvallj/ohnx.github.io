That's pretty much the most important thing to know about me. I pretty much constantly (when I have the time) fiddle with electronics and muck about with programs to try to discover new things (this is still pretty easy for me since I don't know much).<p>I grew up in the age of technology, so since a young age (I'm not really old enough to say "since I was a kid" yet), I was lucky enough to be surrounded by cool gadgets and gizmos that would light up and show words, pictures, and all sorts of other things that I could barely imagine. I was entranced by these contraptions and took every opportunity I could to explore how they worked, whether it was poking my head behind computers to see where wires go, taking apart electronics (but never putting them back together again since I lost a screw), writing programs to practice multiplying numbers, or setting up a new wireless router that my family got. As I grew older and understood more of the things I saw around me, I've also expanded my interests into circuits (most of them involving my Ardiuno or Raspberry Pi) and more programs (ranging from websites to phone apps to low-level operating system interfaces).<p>I also like skiing, swimming, writing, and debating. I might not be good at any of them, but I still do enjoy doing stuff that isn't technology-related sometimes.</div></div><script>function getQueryVariable(e){for(var t=window.location.search.substring(1),n=t.split("&"),r=0;r<n.length;r++){var a=n[r].split("=");if(a[0]==e)return a[1]}return!1}!function(){var e=document.head;e.innerHTML+="<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway:300' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>\n<link href='css/style.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>";var t=window.navigator.userLanguage||window.navigator.language;t&&t.indexOf("fr")>-1&&"y"!=getQueryVariable("forceen")&&(document.location.href="/index-fr.html");var n=window.matchMedia("only screen and (max-width: 500px)");n&&!n.matches||(document.getElementById("spacer").innerHTML="<br />")}()</script><script src=/js/js.js></script>
