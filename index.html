                    Hi! My name is Mason. I'm interested by a lot of things like electronics, space, and politics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I had to pick something that I liked the most, though, I'd probably pick Computer Science.
                    I'm fascinated particularly by the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics.
                    Both of these fields require large amounts of computing power, and, as a result, are some of fields that the most research time is put into.
                    I like learning more about these things, as I feel like they have the most potential to improve the way people live.
                    (After all, who doesn't want to live an easier life!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also like Electrical Engineering.
                    To me, it's quite magical how transistors work, and then how billions of them can be pieced together into a processor.
                    On a much smaller scale, I have an arduino at home, and I make some projects with it sometimes.
                    If I deem a project interesting enough, I will probably post the code behind it online, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a blog, which can be found <a href="https://blog.masonx.ca">here</a>.
                    As with most blogs, it's a reflection of my mind.
                    Naturally, this means that it will probably end up being a hodgepodge of programming projects, short stories, (terrible) drawings, and whatever else my mind throws at me.
